SamsonPHP

SamsonPHP - Module based PHP framework

Micro PHP framework following principles of micro-core, that only provides module 
loading/unloading/management operations, system call stacks, routing and top level rendering.

The main idea that samson\core is citicly minimal, and all the beauty of it's potential is developed
separetely via external modules, giving awesome scalability for SamsonPHP.
